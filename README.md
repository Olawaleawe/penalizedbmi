## Penalized (shrinkage) regression methods for BMI classification
Penalized regression, or regularization, is a type of machine-learning model that
penalizes or reduces the impact of, certain variables. The ridge and lasso
estimates for linear regression parameters are usually Bayesian posterior estimates
when the regression parameters have Normal and independent Laplace
priors, respectively. However, a significant challenge in regularization problems
is that these approaches assume that data are normally distributed, which makes
them not robust to model misspecification. A Bayesian approach for ridge and
lasso models based on empirical likelihood is examined and compared using two datasets on adolescent obesity, based on some socioeconomic and health
risk factors.
